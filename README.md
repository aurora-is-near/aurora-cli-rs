## What is Aurora CLI?
Aurora CLI is a command line interface to bootstrap Aurora blockspace with rapid speed built with rust.

Aurora CLI comes preconfiguration with opinionated, sensible defaults for standard testing environments. If other projects mention testing on Aurora, they are referring to the settings defined in this repo.

**Aurora CLI has the following advantages over a public testnet:**

- Easily modifiable world states
- Quick to reset for rapid iterations
- Simple simulations of different scenarios
